            <h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Investment Philosophy</span>
            </h4>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Embrace Uncertainty</strong> </span>– We think
                    about investing as making moves into the right side of the chart, because every
                    moment is unique and anything can happen on the right side of the chart, it’s
                    impossible to be right all of the time.  Thus, we do not need to be always right to
                    be successful in the market, we need to get through the worst days in the market. 
                    We don’t want to survive “on average 99.5%”.  When it comes to survival, we want to
                    survive through the absolute worst days when the most unexpected events developed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Manage Risk</strong> </span>– To deal with
                    down-side uncertainty effectively, it’s critical to understand the risk, recognize
                    it, and have a consistent approach to deal with it.  It does not mean we can
                    understand everything.  It means we understand the critical dimensions that
                    influence the game as well as acknowledge that there are many things beyond our
                    knowledge boundaries.  Thus, we always proceed with caution.  The best investors
                    make a kill by investing boldly into novel ideas, but with careful calculations and
                    caution.  To our investment system, risk management is key.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Invest Consistently </strong></span>– One of
                    the most tricky thing about investment is that the process can be done perfectly the
                    same between two trades, but the outcomes can be radically different.  That’s
                    explained by uncertainty.  As we cannot ensure the results in investment world, our
                    truest investment goal is not how many percent we make at the end of the year but
                    is to execute every trade idea consistently with the belief that the results will
                    come accordingly in the long-run.  At Altair Cliff, we believe investment is a
                    massive mechanism governs by expected value equation.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Go for the Home Run</strong></span> &#8211; In
                    rare times, and when they come, we will go for the Home Run.  There are times when
                    we earn the right to be aggressive, we will be aggressive and go after the kill.  To
                    have an extraordinary journey in investment, we have to survive the most severe
                    times, grind it out through normal times, and move in for the kill in certain
                    fortunate moments.  In order to locate those moments, we continuously seach and
                    study for every market and life dimension.  We don&#8217;t know to know but know to
                    act.  Still, in turbulence time, the market can behave erratically with substantial
                    volatility that we can end up losing capital even though we are right about the
                    event.  Thus, even on those specific moments, we mandate ourselves to be cautious
                    and be defensively aggressive.</li>

                                    for Excellence</strong></span> – On execution, everything that is
                            executed from Altair Cliff must be at highest dedication to quality.  We
                            take pride in everything that has our name behind it.  Excellence does not
                            naturally come out in investment, gifted minds take countless of trials and
                            (inevidentally lead to) errors, endure prolonged period of external and
                            internal doubts, and go through major difficulties in attaining to their
                            excellency.  We want to be the best of our capability in investment, thus,
                            we value willing to learn, continuously improving, attention to details,
                            open-minded, and, most of all, hard-work.</li>

                            On knowledge, we don&#8217;t know to know, we know to act.  In the current
                            complex world, every vibrant change somewhere in the world means something
                            to the global financial markets.  Thus, we strive our best to learn
                            everything we can about the markets and the world.  That includes history,
                            philosophy, environment, psychology, and cycles of markets and nations.  We
                            strive to trace and learn all of the current flows and form ideas about the
                            world.  Then we express our ideas through executing trades in the financial
                            markets.  We look for knowledge that can be turned into executions.</li>

                            On communication, we communicate in candor on reporting to our Limited
                            Partners, on sharing each of the perspectives in forming investment thesis,
                            and on everything else we communicate daily through-out the market
                            battlefield.  For the first part, we want our Limited Partners to see the
                            world as we see it and know the market as we know it.  If the performance
                            gets clumsy, our Limited Partners will know in the soonest occasion about
                            the details of where the road gets rough and why.  Investing is difficult.
                             Our bond with investors are the most important thing we care.  Candor
                            communication is the only way to build trust in bad and good times.  For the
                            second part, we encourage healthy disagreements and conflicts in
                            communicating about investing ideas and the situations that the team is in.
                             We expect to be in a lot of difficult spots as the market unfolds.  During
                            those times, we don&#8217;t sugarcoat problems and strive for the best ideas
                            that work.  At Altair Cliff, idea wins.</li>
